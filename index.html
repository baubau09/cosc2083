                                Phuong Anh is one of the most dependable team members as she actively contributed new ideas and new ways of doing the assignment. Minh Minh always finished her tasks before the assigned deadlines. Whenever we finished a meeting, I always saw her working on her work in the shared files. Thanh knows how to ask crucial questions, helping everyone to understand the project better. Finally, I found myself actively communicate with other members to clarify each member's part. I rate everyone five out of five.

                                Working and communicating with everyone in Group 2 went well. Every member made an effort to provide constructive feedback for the assignment. However, if we had more time and the opportunity to collaborate in person, we would be able to present more ideas. One surprising but pleasant experience I had while working with the group was how well we worked together when we couldn't have face-to-face interactions. This group assignment taught me a lot about current on-trend applications and technologies. To be more specific, I had never heard of Teleparty prior to this project; researching the technologies behind it for this assignment provided me with additional knowledge and information.                               </p>

                      Background: I was curious about building websites and apps; this is motivation that lured me into the IT industry. After I graduated high school, I jumped right into university and started learning this industry, so unfortunately, I have not any experience in the IT field yet, except for I learned Pascal in my 8th grade. However, after many courses at RMIT I wish to gain more knowledge about software and many other fields  in IT. I would like to apply both creativity and analytics skills so being a software developer is my first goal in this industry.

                                Everyone in the group is passionate about their work in my eyes. I learned a lot from each member of our team honestly. Each of them came with their own unique personality which made our communication balance somehow. The highlight point is team members have contributed their ideas and work effectively. My first impression is Giang, as an extroverted leader of the team; she had excellent communication skills and professional organizing skills. I have learned a lot of how I should take notes about the ideas from her. She has always been the one who led our team to go with the flow so well. The second person who impressed me is Phuong Anh, she has been very professional which I was inspired a lot from her ideas in technology and how she improved herself the passion she had for computer science. Additionally, Phuong Anh introduced the team to interesting websites and ideas that I have never heard before. Thanks to her ideas and work on this project. When it came to Thanh, he was a bit reserved at first, but his questions on project are always on point. This helped other team members develop the project specifically. Lastly, I saw myself as someone who was better at actions, not words. I was really reserved and shy to share my ideas but thanks to the effective communication of the team, I could freely express myself as the members were soft and friendly to others. They appreciated every work from other members. After this course, I changed my perspective about connection and work lifestyles as I gained a lot of knowledge from my team members.

                                Communication and collaboration at work have been developed. Every member was very independent and took responsibility for the tasks well. Additionally, the feedback and ideas that members gave to each other as well as to the project were strongly effective. Every meeting is worth the time since it contributed innovative ideas and magnificent work on RECO. It amazed me how we only worked online through technologies and apps without any face-to-face interaction, but the consequence is always on point. Thanks to the project and my team, I could update more about the importance of Technologies today and many more trendy applications on Technology. Honestly, I have never heard Teleparty before up until Phuong Anh shared the ideas. Yet it would be better if we could have meetings where connection between members could be boosted so that a lot more innovative ideas would be developed to improve RECO features. The wonderful experience in this team impressed me on how communication and collaboration could help a lot in every project. I once thought independent work was more effective and comfortable, but now I already broaden my horizon that together we could develop better ideas, work more effectively. I really appreciate the time working with this team. I can apply a lot of soft skills that I learned from other members to improve my performance in teamwork and self-work in the future.                               </p>

                                Overall, everyone in the group are great teammates who all have contributed greatly to this project. Giang, as a leader, did a great job in organizing and assigning different jobs to each member as well as took her time to explain different aspects of the project to us. Phuong Anh has the most innovative ideas in how we can progress through the project, and despite having a tight schedule, she always actively shares those ideas with the group. Minh Minh has shown her initiative and understanding of the project through her work, which she completed way ahead of deadline. As for me, I think I have done a good job in completing my assigned tasks and giving my views on the project during meeting; however, my communication skill could definitely be improved if I want to work better with my teammates.

                                This is probably one of the best teams I have worked with during my time here at RMIT, due to independence of every member of the group. By having a weekly meeting, we’ve been able to keep everyone up to date and know what their assigned parts are. All confusion in assignment description has also been cleared by asking the lecturer. This shows that communication is a strong suit for this team. However, it could have been much better if we had face-to-face meetings instead of online meetings through Team. Additionally, the team could have been much more efficient if we could physically access different RMIT’s learning facilities. I am really surprised by how experienced and professional my teammates are, I think I’ve learnt a lot of things from them through this assignment, things that I can use for my future course works. One of them is the importance of meetings in a group assignment. Before, I never really thought of the need for regular meetings, but after working with this team, I realized that these meetings are essential for effective group work and are the opportunity for teammates to show their initiative.

                                In terms of teamwork, I am satisfied with both performance, attitude, and communication of the team. We have an awesome leader, Ms. Giang, who is very experienced in management, allowing her to neatly delegate tasks and operations. Thanh and Minh are both the youngest, but very professional and always complete their tasks ahead of the deadline. The team also assisted me a lot in writing reports, as I have a tight schedule with four courses and my job. Everyone has contributed critical points to the project idea and communicated effectively. I rate every five out of five.

                                The most awesome aspect of this team, for me, is that everyone constantly encourages others during this hectic period of the semester. It is safe to say that the teamwork culture here is above and beyond. I wish I could meet them all when in-person learning is back at RMIT. The most challenging part was when we planned the user flow and user experience for designing the prototype. The project idea seemed to be perfect at first, but when we went into the details of the application, and we had to re-evaluate a lot of features. This process involves an enormous amount of critical and logical thinking. I have learned a lot about user experience design, product design, as well as UI design. Besides, there are members in the team who do not talk much, but they prove their determination through actions. I have come to the realization that hard-working people do not have to be extroverted or talkative. Overall, I am really passionate about this project idea, and I hope that I could implement the actual application for production in the future.                               </p>

                    <h3>Group processes</h3>
                    <p>
                      At first, the group members sent their profiles into the chat to get to know each other. We had 2 extroverts and 2 introverts. In the first meeting, introverts tended to be shy, but fortunately extroverts helped the group to discuss the plans smoothly which was very appreciating. After that, group members could finally discuss quite well with each other and gave great ideas to the assignment. Everyone in the group takes responsibility for their tasks and gets them done on time. Thanks to the extroverts in the group helping the other members connect to each other well so that people could freely express their ideas and did their parts amazingly. Moreover, group members also encouraged each other to boost their energy for the assignments. The team went well with different personalities and backgrounds, which is extremely incredible.

                    <p>
                      If the Assignment 3 is extended, group members wish to meet face-to-face so that people can get to each other more, this could help us a lot in our future if we meet again and need each other’s help. Assume that in the future we could work together again in the same company or on other courses. Moreover, if we could meet each other, and the assignment is extended, our project may have more updates on the features due to innovative ideas and feedback that we could get from our users. Taking feedback and fixing the app takes a long time to complete the project so longer given time may lead to better quality for our app. Also, extending time could help us test the features with many more people and ourselves in real life, this could ensure the quality of our app.

                    <h3>Career plans</h3>
                    <p>
                      Minh wants to be a software developer, while Thanh's passion is concentrated on game development. Phuong Anh dreams of being a full-stack developer, and she is making the first step as a front-end engineer intern. Giang has experience in the project management career path that she wants to continue.                     </p>
                    <p>
                      These four jobs require some common skills, including cooperating with others (clients and coworkers), thinking computationally, and understanding at least one programming language.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, the differences lay in the detail of each path. Developing the logic, the characters, and other interactable objects within the game are often the primary tasks of a game developer. Whereas a software developer typically works on the more technical side, such as programming and testing software, from its beginning to completion, ensuring it works as it should. Combining both front and back-end knowledge, a full-stack developer with machine learning knowledge would be able to turn data into actionable insights and implement them by building intelligent applications that learn from historical experience. A project manager makes sure things are running smoothly within the development team while negotiating to ensure that the deadlines are reasonable for the best possible outcomes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The similarities in each career path are that they all revolve around computers in some way, shape, or form. We all plan to graduate from RMIT with many hands-on experiences, and all have a strong foundation of knowledge of computer science. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Further in the future, a software developer's career path will mainly be improving upon the already developed software and bringing inventive software ideas to life. Similarly, a game developer will design and develop more creative games, as well as improve the already released games. The full-stack developer is the most diverse of them all as they can do both front and back end, and project managers will be helping organize and run projects along with making sure all tasks are completed on time.

                  This project will be a movie streaming platform called RECO, where users can not only watch a selection of movies in high definition but also share their real-time experience with others within the same session. Reco will focus on the socializing aspect of the watching movies activity, which is extremely lacking with the current pandemic situation, in Vietnam as well as the world. Beside allowing the user to watch movies, the app will also have a built-in recommending system, in which users can pre-define their “taste” in movies, allowing the system to find and recommend the most suitable movies to the user through learning algorithm. This will ensure that the user will have the best experience while using the app, alone or with others. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reco is currently being proposed as a mobile app, but if it was developed successfully, the team may even consider bringing it to other platforms, such as desktop or even smart TVs to allow a wider accessibility, further reinforcing the idea of connecting people through Reco. It will be a new way for people to meet and make friends, similar to how social media works, not just during the pandemic, but also for our normal day to day life.

                  It has been a long time since the COVID-19 pandemic first appeared which led to huge changes in citizens’ lives. Connection between people is affected obviously during the continuous lockdown since people cannot have meetings normally like they did before. Consequently, it is becoming more difficult for citizens to share their hobbies and interests with each other. The act of sharing by texting through technical devices is much different from face-to-face experience. The motivation to create this app is helping people to share their hobbies in their free time such as watching movies together. Movie theaters have been closed for 1 year due to social distancing so it must be a while since people could watch movies together with high quality. Sharing screens to watch movies together through Discord, Zoom, etc. reduces the quality of the movies inevitably. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  This app allows people to watch movies together with better quality. Additionally, people can share their interest in movies with each other by discussing it while watching it together without being afraid of annoying other people like in movie theaters. This is the key to maintaining the connection between human beings during COVID-19 situation. Besides, our app has a filter to pick a movie by filtering genres that people in the same group like to watch. It helps them to find a suitable movie that includes genres that all people in the same group are into watching so they can watch it together. There is no certain claim that this pandemic will end soon. Therefore, our motivation is to help people have a great time-sharing hobby with each other such as watching movies together since citizens cannot go out normally like they did before.

                  The concept of having a synchronized watch sessions between devices and users has been done before by Teleparty, a web browser extension. However, unlike Teleparty, Reco will use this concept and develop upon it with additional features, making it a standalone app. This will make Reco less prone to bugs and errors, as well as opening up opportunity for the team to expand on the idea in future iterations of the app. Furthermore, Reco will have a much wider interact options for its users, such as the implementation of friend list, setting schedules for a watch session, or even browse a selection of watch rooms created by others.

                      <strong>The Main Aim: Making RECO </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      RECO is the focal point of our team. The team has identified a number of problems in the world at the moment as mentioned in the Overview section. To address those problems, we came up with RECO, a system where people around the world can connect and enjoy their favorite movies together. To fulfill this aim, we would need to achieve the following goals: 
                    </p>

                                The User Interface is the first thing that every potential user looks at when they consider using an application or not. Because of this, it is important that the interface of RECO is interesting and intuitive. For a movie related application like RECO, this could be something like a darker theme to simulate a movie theatre room, or a clean and fully functioning video control panel.                               </p>

                                The trouble of choosing a fitting movie for you and your friends is a common problem nowadays. The team addresses this problem by having a learning algorithm that uses a user’s watching patterns and prior movie choices to select the most enjoyable movie for that individual. This will ensure the user will have the best experience using RECO and not wasting time selecting a movie for a session.                               </p>

                                The biggest goal of our project is to connect people together through their interest in movies, so it is important that we can provide the best social experience to our users. RECO will not only be a place where people can watch movies, it is where people can share that experience with their friends and family. To achieve this, the team will have to do research on movie streaming platforms along side with social media sites. Friend list, chat room, face cam, are some of the things that will be utilized in RECO to emphasize on this aspect of the system.                               </p>

                                Just like any business projects, the development of RECO should bring back a reward for the team beside solving the identified problems. Throughout the development, team members will learn a lot of new things regarding the software development life cycle. Especially for RECO, where many innovating IT concepts are being implemented such as machine learning algorithm or management of servers. After that, if the release of RECO was a success, it could also mean profit for the team through different methods of monetization.

                      It was amazing how there are numbers of students out there, but we chose to be in the same team and have worked together up until now. It was such an appreciating chance for each of us to get to know more about different people all over the nations with various backgrounds and personalities. Giang and Anh knew each other first since they were on the same team on a different course. On week-8 tutorial class, students introduced themselves to find teammates, Giang asked Minh to join the team. We called it the team of girls in IT industry at first, there might be a connection between girls at that time. One week later, Thanh joined the team as well. That was how we found each other; the team was completed.

                                On week 10, team members started to share their assignments 2 to consider the project that members will develop in assignment 3, which is a group project. Anh’s ideas about technology impressed the team members. She had 2 ideas, first one is a game to educate the citizens the information of every vaccine that the world has now. Some citizens were concerned about vaccination so this app helps them to gain knowledge about the vaccines, citizens can make choices themselves choosing one. The second idea is our developing project, RECO. This project allows citizens to watch movies together including video-call, voice-call, chatting, it is alike calls on other apps but now they can watch movies together with the best quality. The team members voted for this idea since people have been on social distancing for months and the members were sure about other people missing watching movies at the cinema together as well. Additionally, there has been no certain claim about when the cinema could work again since COVID-19 made it hard to predict the situation. The team saw the potential in development of this app.  
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Our app has a unique feature which is inspired by Tinder. Users can filter their favorite films or movie genres by swiping right, if it is not users’ movie types then users will swipe left. RECO can filter a list of movies by users’ favorite, we will use AI (Artificial Intelligence) for this feature. In a room which different users can watch together in that room, this feature can help all the room users to pick movies based on each member’s favorite as well. Users will stop wasting time picking movies then end up not watching any movies with RECO. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                We have discussed this and brainstormed our ideas for the RECO project in the first meeting. At first, we were inspired a lot by Tinder features swiping right and left. This app used to be like an app in which different users find their common favorites of movies, music, hobbies from strangers. It is difficult for people to find someone who has the same types in movies and music or hobbies these days. This app would help them with that. However, after discussing for a while, the team members felt like this was out of their control since this kind of app requires big data and many else features, we did not have enough time to develop it. Therefore, team members decided to fix the app to watch movies together based on users’ favorite movie types only. The highlight point is we will use AI (Artificial Intelligence) for the feature which helps users to pick their favorite movie types. After that, the team members discussed the flow of the apps and the features that our app should have. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Meetings frequently happened on Saturday, the second meeting team members talked about how the features should be placed and we filtered out some of the ones which were unnecessary. We developed deeper ideas for each feature in our UI/UX such as home, friend list, the movies users like, rooms, etc. After discussing about the features, we brainstormed the ideas that we should write on the assignment. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The third and fourth meetings assigned tasks for the members to write about the assignments. Besides, the team members discussed the roles that each member played in the presentation as well. The ideas on presentation were also included in these meetings. Lastly, Anh showed the members the prototype of our app. Up until this point, meetings went smoothly since the members contributed great ideas and communicated about the process to each other effectively. However, there were already many ideas which are alike our RECO project, therefore we needed to spend more time to find and enhance our ideas for RECO that help it becomes the unique app in these meetings. We found out that there was Teleparty which its use was the same as RECO. However, it is only available on websites with PC (Personal Computer) and Laptops. For this reason, we decided to make RECO an app on phones officially. This would help users to take less time to access. Additionally, since we could not meet face-to-face, for the presentation each member recorded themselves following the part that they took, one member would edit the videos later. All the tasks belonging to each member were all decided in these meetings which completed 75% of our assignment process. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                After that, while organizing the project, other obstacles come up. We had trouble designing our website and prototype since team members rarely had UI experience. Luckily, Phuong Anh had a designer friend who taught her to design the prototype. She also did research to find interesting templates for our website. Although it took us a while to solve this problem out, but the results were incredible. Consequently, our design for RECO prototype and website was satisfying enough. Phuong Anh took charge of the groups’ technical parts a lot including websites and prototype. Giang was the video editor and note taker for our presentation. Besides, Thanh and Minh contributed their writing work on the project before the deadlines every time. Our collaboration went effectively. Up until now, every part in the assignment had been 90% completed. Our last step was making videos for our presentation and checking on our ideas in the assignment again.  
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                As everything went well, our meeting happened only once in the last week to answer any concerns that the team members had. Mostly the topic was about how to build and what to talk about in the presentation. Minh would introduce the group and took responsibility for the first part, problems led to the project and problems that the project was facing. Thanh will talk about the solutions which is why RECO was born. Phuong Anh showed the prototype of RECO and introduced the features to users. Lastly, Giang would be talking about the revenue model. All members had to do know is contribute their work on GitHub and record the videos for the presentation. It was also our last official meeting.

                    <h3>Roles </h3>
                    <p>
                      Phuong Anh has a lot of experience with software development in general. She participates in several Hackathons and is a front-end developer intern, so it would be natural for her to lead this project as a lead developer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Minh Minh would benefit from being a developer of Reco because it would enable her to gain hands-on experience, allowing her to move one step closer to her dream of becoming a software developer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thanh wants to become a game developer, which means he needs a lot of experience in UI/UX design to capture users' attention. Thus, being a UI/UX designer for Reco would contribute to his dream path. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Giang is thinking of improving her skills to be a better project manager, and as a project manager, she would need to understand what to check for before delivering the product. In order to do that, she needs to understand the basics of product testing, which is why being a tester suits her the best for this project. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Every team member has one primary charge, but ensuring that the project stays on track, communicating inside and outside of the group, and reporting progress are all responsibilities that each member should have.

                                This project does not include a content management system, where administrators, contributors, or content creators have a front-end to freely upload new movies or TV shows. Moreover, the application does not support direct streaming as it is not a streaming service itself. It can only fetch data to watch when the user has already connected to their streaming platform like Netflix, FPT Play or VieON. It also does not allow users to rate movies on a 5-point scale system.

                    <p>
                      The team has agreed on using several tools for different purposes to complete the project planning tasks involving communication, website development, document collaboration, and UI/UX design.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i class="ri-stop-fill"></i> As for communication, our team utilize Microsoft Teams and Facebook Messenger for meetings and quick messages.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i class="ri-stop-fill"></i> We utilize the convenience of Microsoft Office Online for document collaboration including final reports and presentations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i class="ri-stop-fill"></i> The website is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and GitHub is used for development collaboration.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i class="ri-stop-fill"></i> As for UI/UX design, Figma serves the purpose, and it is an excellent tool for wireframe prototyping. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In terms of application development, the React Native framework is chosen to build the cross-platform mobile application’s front-end. Additionally, on the back-end side, we will implement our recommender system algorithm by using Node.JS and a NoSQL database, MongoDB. This choice of back-end technology would be a wonderful fit to build a blazing fast and highly scalable system for a real-time video streaming and calling platform.

                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Early Development: </strong>
                      <br>
                      Before any programming in this project, the team will need to know the requirements for the app itself, meaning what RECO will do and how the users use RECO. It is important that this step is done thoroughly to avoid increasing testing and debugging cost in the future. 
                      <br>
                      We can do this by giving out surveys to our target market. An early mockup will be made based on the requirements and given to selected groups. In this case, it is most convenient to choose students within RMIT, or relatives of project members due to the pandemic situation. This way, we can get early feedback on different aspects such as UI/UX, software features, etc. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>During Development: </strong>
                      <br>
                      After gathering requirements, we will begin the programming phase. Here, programmers will write modules for the software. It is the programmer’s responsibility to make sure the functions and procedures within the module are working properly through white box and black box testing. Interactions between modules must also be tested by the developers to make the system can work together as a whole. This process can be done faster by using a good IDE for development, which can provide debugging tools such as syntax highlight, error highlight, executing selected codes. 
                      <br>
                      Various kinds of tools can be used for efficient testing in this phase. Trello or similar tools can be used to create a checklist of test cases, allowing the tester to go through each case and know what parameters to pass. Additionally, GitHub is also a great tool for version control, in which if an error is found in one iteration, we can roll back to a previous functioning version. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>After Development: </strong>
                      <br>
                      RECO should be fully functional software at this stage; however, we can further test it to ensure it is truly ready for deployment. An Alpha test version is released among project’s members, those who know the internal functions of the system. If any bugs were encountered, the team can fix it immediately. This process can be time-consuming, but it is needed before we can release Beta version. The Beta will be given to RMIT students for testing and feedback. The reason we choose RMIT students is because they have diverse backgrounds and domain knowledge, which we believe is essential to provide us with constructive criticisms. Any feedback and bugs found with the beta version will be compiled and evaluate in the next iteration of RECO.

                    <h3>Time frame</h3>
                    <p>We intend to use the API-first development strategy. This approach makes future expansion to the application efficient. Overall, we plan to develop essential APIs first, then creating the application and testing in chain for about seven weeks, followed by internal testing and debugging for four weeks. Finally, we will release the beta version for user test during week 16 while planning for the web application expansion. </p>

                    <h3>Risks </h3>
                    <p>
                      There are many risks when it comes to software development; no projects are immune from risk. Therefore, without identifying clearly as many risks as possible before the project, it will increase the chance of failing. This section will cover some of the risks that this project may encounter during and after development: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Copyright and Ownership Issues</b> – One of the biggest concerns when creating RECO is that the team does not own any movies, but rather we will partner with other streaming platforms such as Netflix or HBO Max to stream their movies. Because of this, there will need to be an agreement between the team and those streaming companies to allow us to include their contents in RECO. It will also require the user to own the subscription to a specific streaming service to be able to watch it on our app. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>User Interface Implementation</b> – The current team has limited knowledge on the interface design aspect of software development. Because of this, we might not be able to fully implement every function with every component shown in the current UI/UX design. This will affect the final usability of our software when deploy to our customers, leading to a drop in user experience. To overcome this problem, the team might need to outsource to front-end developers and designers, which will affect the available budget of the project. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Limited Accessibility</b> – RECO is currently being developed for a mobile platform, including mobile phones and tablets. Meaning people who want to use RECO on PC or smart TV would need to use a third-party software to do so. This will affect the number of potential users that RECO can have, especially since most people enjoy watching movies on a big monitor. The team wants to extend the working platform for RECO in the future if the current project succeeds. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Security</b> – To use RECO, user will have to register an account, meaning their personal information will be stored on the team’s server. Since the software will also require to accessing user’s information from other services such as Netflix or Amazon, the security of RECO’s server needs to be put in high priority. Failing to secure user’s data in this case may lead to serious consequences. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Communication during Pandemic</b> – With the current situation of COVID-19, the team is limited in term of communication. Without a face-to-face meeting, it might be difficult for the team to convey ideas from one to another, which may lead to misunderstanding during requirement gathering and developing. Not only for internal communication, acquiring external services will also be a challenge that requires more time and resources. 
                    </p>

                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-lg-12 details order-2 order-lg-1">
                    <h3>Group processes and communications </h3>
                    <p>
                      Our daily communication is via a created group on Team and Messenger on Facebook. We chose Team since it is more convenient to find members through student id at first. Discussion about the assignment and brainstorming ideas are through Team because voice-to-voice meetings are more connecting which make it more productive and easier to develop the assignment. When there was not important enough to have meetings on Team, Messenger was chosen as it is common social media in Vietnam which we all use it day-to-day, we found it easier to chat with each other through Messenger whenever we need to announce the stages of assignment process. One member in our group created it after we found teammates on week 8. Our meetings are available twice a week from week 9. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Although all the members were busy with last week's assignments from different courses, they were still highly active in communicating with the team to work on the project. Therefore, there was no case that a group member did not respond to the communications. However, if this situation happened, the other members would try to remind that member about their responsibility politely. After that, we would give them the tasks that belong to their responsibility in the assignment and give them the deadlines that everyone in the group already discussed before. We would check that member’s process two days before the deadlines just in case that member did not take his/her responsibility. If he/she were in the process and finished their tasks before the deadlines, everything would be fine as there were no obstacles in our process. In contrast, if he/she ignored his/her responsibility, we would do it ourselves to complete the tasks on deadlines and will talk with the lecturer about the situation later. We would ask the lecturer to consider the situation and to give the scores fairly since we are all adults, and we must be responsible for what we have done.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our communication outside the class happened frequently on Messengers since we need to announce the stages of our process, about two to four times a week.  
                    </p>

              RECO would need one full-stack developer, one machine learning engineer, one UI/UX designer, and one tester based on the timeframe. While there are some base requirements every member would need to meet, such as experience in teamwork with at least two projects and managing tasks schedule, each role requires its specific technical skills.
